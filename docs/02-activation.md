# Webex Instant Connect configuration

Log in https://instant.webex.com as a Webex administrator in your Webex Meetings Guest-2-Guest organization, and:

1. Click on **Begin Integration**

2. Check that Instant Connect is activated

Now we are ready to use the Webex Instant Connect API! In this lab you will learn how to do it both manually,  and also automatically using Webex Connect.

You can also configure Instant Connect appearance by adding your organization name and logo. This has been already done for you, have a look:

1. Go to **Appearance**, here is where you could change the **Organization Name** and the **logo**

2. Go to **Feature Customization**, these are all the features that you can enable/disable for your meetings in one click, making Instant Connect a flexible and easy to customize solution. Do not change any of these options for now
